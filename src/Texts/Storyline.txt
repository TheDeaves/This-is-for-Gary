You wake up. It's hot. You're inside or underground, can't tell, doesn't matter... 
There's daylight at the end of the tunnel and you are shoved towards the entrance and you are handed a sword...
Before you can ask him his name in return, the man screams and lunges at you! Defend yourself!
TIP: The player chooses a direction to attack and the enemy attempts to block in the same direction.
After the enemy dies at your feet, the crowd comes to a roar and two handlers run out and shove you back inside. 
TIP: Attacking the head is only a 30% chance to hit!
