# This-is-for-Gary
This is the story about a man who lost their best friend and is forced to fight as a gladiator. This is for you Gary, you beautiful bastard.

This game is called This is for Gary! Welcome to it! It's a text-based adventure combat game that you play as yourself, attacked by bandits. As you are losing consciousness from a blow to the head, you see your best friend, Gary, take a spear to the chest and die.

Everything goes dark......

The combat is turn-based, but allows the user to choose 1 of 3 directions to attack from, left, right, or the head. 
    The player chooses a direction to strike and the NPC chooses a direction to block.
    ei. if the player swings left and the NPC blocks rights, all damage is negated.

    The player and NPC then switch sides until either the player wins or dies.
